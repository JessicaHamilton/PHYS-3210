## Week 02: More Advanced Python

### Exercise 1: Making Your (Coding) Life Easier

Write a function to compute the viral load for HIV after administering 
an antiretroviral drug (Problem 5.1 in text; Week 1, Problem 1). The 
function should accept values for `A`, `B`, `alpha`, `beta`, and `time` 
as input and return the viral load, V(t).

Using your function, plot the function for a different combinations of 
`A` and `alpha` (fix `B` and `beta` as you did in Problem 5.1). Add axis
labels, a plot title, and a legend with unique labels for each plotted
curve. Save the figure as a PDF or other image file, add it to a Word 
document, and describe how adjusting `A` and `alpha` change the function's 
properties. Be sure to reference your figure and describe each change
in detail.
