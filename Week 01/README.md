## Week 01: Introduction to Python & GitHub

This week, we are going to dive into Python, which is the primary programming 
language that we will use this semester. Before we do, we need to make sure that
we have all of the necessary software and/or user accounts to begin our work.

**User Accounts**:
 - [GitHub](https://github.com) (if you do not already have one)

**Software**:
 - [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (w/ Spyder, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, VPython)
 - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Preliminaries



### Exercise 1: Debugging

Open `Exercise_01.py` after following along with Chapter 1 (see above). You may 
either open the exericse directly in GitHub, or you may download the python 
_script_ and open it using Spyder.

The code is supposed to compute the hypotenuse of a triangle using NumPy's square
root function for a triangle with sides *a* = 3 units and *b* = 4 units. It then
prints out the values of the hypotenuse (side *c*) to the screen. Unfortunately,
your colleague (\*\**cough*\*\* me \*\**cough*\*\*) wrote a code filled with *bugs*, i.e., 
errors that prevent the script from running properly. They have asked you to help
them fix their code. __Your job is to find each bug and write a short report for 
your colleague explaining (1) where there's an error, (2) why it's an error, 
and (3) how to fix the error.__ 

Before you do anything else, write down what you expect the hypotenuse should be 
equal to after the script finishes. [no calculator required] Next, read over the
code line-by-line and make sure you agree with what your colleague has done. 
You can also open Spyder and start entering the code line-by-line into the 
IPython console. Once you have identified each error in the code, write up your
report and submit it by opening an Issue on GitHub. [Advanced] Edit the script, 
upload it to your repository, and create a pull request. 

Finally, answer the following question:

> Why does the value for c have a decimal, while the values for a and b do not? 
Explain.

You're now ready for Chapter 2!
