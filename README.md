## Evaluation &amp; Assessment
You will be evaluated and assessed with five different metrics: In-Class Exercises,
Homework, Independent Project, 3 Midterms, and a cumulative Final Exam.

 | Category  | Weight |
 |-----------|  :---: |
 | Exercises |  15%   |
 | Labs      |  25%   |
 | Project   |  15%   |
 | Midterms  |  30%   |
 | Final     |  15%   |

To be clear, each midterm exam is weighted at 10%, for a total of 30% across the
three midterms.

### In-Class Exercises
During a typical week, Monday and Wednesday will be reserved for working through
tutorial exercises that guide you through a particular skill or set of skills. This
may include 10 - 15 minutes for a short lecture to reinforce and/or clarify material
presented in your textbook that will be relevant for the day's exercise(s).

### Labs
Fridays are reserved for working through more complicated problems that require
applying skills learned on Monday and Wednesday. It's essentially a lab day where
the problems may carry over as homework. They will require write ups that include
derivations, description of your methodology, and analysis of your results.

### Project
You are required to undertake an independent project to solve a real-world problem
using techniques learned in class or those contained in later chapters of _Computational
Physics_.

### Midterms
You'll have three midterm exams on __20 September 2019__, __25 October 2019__, and
__21 November 2019__. They will largely be testing your understanding of when a
particular method is applicable and the conceptual basis for various numerical
techniques. All coding on midterms will be written as pseudo-code.

### Final Exam
There will be a cumulative final exam on __Monday 09 December 2019__ at 10:20 in
Rogers 103. It will be a similar format as the midterms and may have a take-home
component.

### Grading Scale
| Percentage | Letter Grade |
|   :---:    |     :---:    |
|    93+     |       A      |
|  83 - 92   |       B      |
|  70 - 82   |       C      |
|  60 - 70   |       D      |
|   < 60     |       F      |
