## Description

HIV infection time course.

File HIVseries.mat contains a single variable `a` with two columns of data.  The
first is the time in days since administration of a treatment to an HIV positive
patient; the second contains the concentration of virus in that patient's blood,
in arbitrary units.

HIVseries.csv and HIVseries.npy contain the same data in the same format.
HIVseries.npz contains the same data in two separate arrays called
`time_in_days` and `viral_load`.
