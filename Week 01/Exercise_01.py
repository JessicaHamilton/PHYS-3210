Exercise: Chapter 01, Kinder & Nelson

    Download and run this script or, enter each line into an IPython console. 
    There are a few errors in the script. Try to find and correct them. Make 
    note of each error and explain (1) why it's an error, and (2) how to fix 
    it. 
    
    NOTE: there may be more than one way to fix an error
    
    Once you have the script working, explain why the value for c has a decimal
    and the values for a and b do not.
